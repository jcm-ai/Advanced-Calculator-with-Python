**Outcome of this project:**

## Getting Started
- **Install Python:** Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- Clone the Repository:
```Bash
git clone https://github.com/jcm-ai/Advanced-Calculator-with-Python.git
```
**Tkinter usually comes pre-installed with Python. You can check its availability by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:**

```Bash
python -m tkinter
```
*If the Tkinter window appears, you're good to go. If not, you might need to install it.*

**Run the script:**
- Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS or Linux).
- Navigate to the directory where your script is saved using the cd command. For example:
```Bash
cd path/to/your/script
```

**Run the script by typing:**
```Bash
python advanced_calculator.py
```
## Usage
